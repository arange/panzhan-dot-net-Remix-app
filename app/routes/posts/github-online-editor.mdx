# Github Online Editor

This article is **created**, **merged**, **deployed** on my iPad.

And it is made possible by <ExLink>[Github Online Editor](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor#opening-the-web-based-editor)</ExLink>. If you don't already know about it, you should definitely take a look, especially if you're deploying your app using **Vercel** or **Netlify** that goes serverless and only requires you to update your github repo for deployment.

I'm loving it, so I believe you will too.

## Alternative

Now if you don't want to "develop" your app, but instead just wanna post a new article or edit an old one, <ExLink>[prose.io](https://prose.io/)</ExLink> probably suits your need even better (This particular paragraph is added using prose.io on my iPhone). I can't imagine someone developing on a mobile phone no matter how 'pro-max' it is.

## Some complains

I know both VS Code and Github are maintained by **_Microsoft_** now, but you can't fool me by renaming `VS Code Online Editor` to `Github Online Editor` ðŸ™„

Also, it would be great if Copilot is able to run online, sometimes you do like those auto completions when typing on your iPad (not to mention mobile phones).
